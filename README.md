<h1>Caribou</h1>
<p> This is my first project's repo. I'm still developing that and I've got great ideas about that project. </br>
I'm waiting for helps or partners.</p>

<h2> General Idea </h2> 
<p> This software serves predictions about your activity(any activity,real world activites) efficiency-performance before activity happens.</p>


<h2> Usage </h2>

<p> Firstly you need the use this software until conditions are met. Software gets the data from you with this conditions. </br>
 If you ask 'what are the terms? ':</br>
<strong>Stipulation 1:</strong><i> At least two different activity must entered.</i></br>
<strong>Stipulation 2:</strong><i> Each activity has to repeat at least 15 times.</i></br>
After this stipulations met prediction circuts(ML kernels) starts to work. </br>
Simply design of project is that.</br>
